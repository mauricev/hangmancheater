Consider the following two screenshots from a flutter app. The first is from the app runniing on the iPad simulator. The second is from the web. Why do the (green) graphic images look different. 

iPad

web (or Mac)

int? Function()? retrieveValue,
void Function(int newValue)? updateValue) 


cMinHangmanLetters, cMaxHangmanLetters, viewModel.fetchNumberOfLetters, viewModel.setNumberOfLetters

usability
flexibility

DragTarget<String>(
          onAccept: (String letter) {
            viewModel.addUnusedLetter(letter);
          },
          builder: (BuildContext context, List<String?> draggedLetterList, List notUsedList) {
            String? hoveringLetter = draggedLetterList.isNotEmpty ? draggedLetterList.first : null;
            return Container(
              alignment: Alignment.center,
              height: 50.0,
              width: 200.0,
              color: Colors.grey[200],
              child: hoveringLetter != null  ? Text("Dropping $hoveringLetter") : const Text("Drag Unused Letters Here"),
            );
          },
        ),


first we need to have code that toggles between the three states. we need to see if i get a splash effect when tapping an empty field
the first tap should whiten the field. the second tap should unwhiten the field if it is not occupied. if it is occupied, then it should whiten the field (remove the letter) and the second tap should deaden the field.

how do we store this state in display text. 
dead is a 0
white (live) is an underscore, though we may or may not display this with an actual underscore
white with a letter is the actual letter

need to allow for wheel of fortune
hyphen
apostrophe
question mark 
period
& symbol
number sign

for the compendium, it needs to be able to extract only the first line
no, for these matches, it's not clear how the game is being played; does the user guess the 

for wheel of fortune good news and bad. we know where the spaces will be since spaces aren’t part of the white letters
so we can know when to include a space character
but we don’t know about the non-alphabetic, non-space characters such as the hyphen, 

another problem, can these non-alphabetic, non-space characters be excluded. 
// we can simply say they can't be excluded, so they can only be added 
can't exclude (name of character)
can't exclude &
can’t exclude .

to build the range, we add only letters that are not excluded
and we a grep range of them
the non-space, non-alphabetics are never excluded, so we can just append them after the range, correct?

 actualText[theActualTextIndex] = theCharacter;
        theActualTextIndex++;

we scan for non-zeros
when we get a non-zero
turn on space scanning

store m, q, k, s
we see a zero we set space scannning to true
if space scanning is set to true and character is zero
we store a space
and disable space scanning

we scan for letters or underlines


-space__
if the character is not the defautl
