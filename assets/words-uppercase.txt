YOU AND WHOSE ARMY?
YOU AND YOURS
YOU BET
YOU BET YOUR ASS
YOU BETCHA
YOU CAN BET YOUR BOOTS
YOU CAN BET YOUR BOTTOM DOLLAR
YOU CAN LEAD A HORSE TO WATER BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE IT DRINK
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN!
YOU CAN TALK
YOU CAN'T GET A QUART INTO A PINT POT
YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO
YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER
YOU CAN'T KEEP A GOOD MAN DOWN
YOU CAN'T LOSE
YOU CAN'T MAKE A SILK PURSE OUT OF A SOW'S EAR
YOU CAN'T MAKE BRICKS WITHOUT STRAW
YOU CAN'T PUT AN OLD HEAD ON YOUNG SHOULDERS
YOU CAN'T TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS
YOU CAN'T WIN THEM ALL
YOU CATCH MORE FLIES WITH HONEY THAN WITH VINEGAR
YOU COULD HAVE FOOLED ME!
YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT UP
YOU DON'T SAY!
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
YOU HAVEN'T LIVED!
YOU KNOW
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
YOU LIVE AND LEARN
YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE HANGED FOR A SHEEP AS FOR A LAMB
YOU MUST BE JOKING
YOU MUST BE KIDDING
YOU NAME IT
YOU NEVER KNOW
YOU PAYS YOUR MONEY AND YOU TAKES YOUR CHOICE
YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW
YOU SAID IT!
YOU SCRATCH MY BACK AND I'LL SCRATCH YOURS
YOU WAIT
YOU WOULDN'T CATCH — DOING SOMETHING
YOU WOULDN'T READ ABOUT IT
